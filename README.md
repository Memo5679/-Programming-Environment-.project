# Technical Report about Fundamentals Technologies used in Iconic Programming Environment Based 

--------------------------

Programming, a very interesting skill and very important area. Almost every device around us today is related - in a way or another - to programming. For instance, Computers, Smartphones, TVs, Cameras, Calculates, Satellite, Airplanes, Some cars, Cameras … and so on and so forth. So Programming is a very important thing in our life today, but one main drawback of programming is that it is somehow complicated. 
 
It is not very easy to learn the concept of programming at first, or the idea of algorithms, or the flow of the serial or parallel statements. More research in this field has revealed that the weakness of problem-solving skills is because of the complexities associated with the development environment and the language syntax that novices use. All that leads to create an easier way to introduce the novice to Programming. 
 
We as human beings are able to deal with Images and visualizations in better way than written words. For example, it is much easier for us to remember image of objects with specific colors than write down the object’s name and the name of its color. So, this is why the idea of visualizing algorithms (or iconic programming) was initialized. Many available software support tools for introducing novices to programming are subsequently based on a flowchart which acts as a visual aid in programming to help increase problem-solving skills. This paper is showing a review of some programming environments based on an iconic notation is carried out with a focus on the support provided for introducing novices to programming.
